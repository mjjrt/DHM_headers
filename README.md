# Digital Heart Monitor Extension Board

This repo contains header files for use with the breakout shield used in the 'Medical Technology - Selected Digital Topics' lab course.

## About this 
This repo contains four important things:
```
buttonArray.h
display.h
button/
examples/
```
About the first two, see the following paragraph.
`button` contains a small library of two files, which is in essence an implementation of the Arduino Button library, but with an object oriented approach. The `Button` class can be implemented in an array, which makes initialization of more than a few buttons _really_ easy.

## Usage 
The header files, if placed in the same directory as the Arduino `.ino` file, can be included with:
```
#include "buttonArray.h"
#include "display.h"
```

They are written to specifically work with the following hardware:
- 3.5" UNO 320x480 TFT Display Module (Driver: ILI0486);
- 12 Buttons, wired normally high.

## Credit
These header files were written during my work as an assistant for the 'Medical Technology - Selected Digital Topics' lab course for the Biomedical Engineering Masters Program in the 2022 summer term at LÃ¼beck University of Applied Sciences.
